# interface:
interface only declare 
public interface Inf1
{
public void Area();
public void calc();

}
## one class can use multiple interface
interface is structure we can modify based on user need

# implements is keyword used for interface 


##multiple inheritance : more than one parents 
inhertiance = extend keyword
one class cannot extend mulitple inheritance
  the ambigutiy will be generated
child class will confuesed
to reduce complex we cannot use multiple inheritance

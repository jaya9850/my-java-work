In Java, throw and throws are both used for exception handling, but they serve different purposes:

**throw keyword:**
- Used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code.
- Can throw both checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Syntax: throw new ExceptionType("Error Message");
- Example:
  ```java
  public void checkAge(int age) {
      if (age < 18) {
          throw new ArithmeticException("Age must be 18 or above");
      }
  }
  ```

**throws keyword:**
- Used in method signatures to declare that a method might throw one or more exceptions.
- Informs the caller of the method about possible exceptions that must be handled.
- Syntax: returnType methodName() throws ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2 { ... }
- Example:
  ```java
  public void readFile(String filename) throws IOException {
      // Code that may throw IOException
  }
  ```

**Summary:**
- throw: Actually throws an exception.
- throws: Declares potential exceptions in the method signature.

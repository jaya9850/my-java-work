# 📅 Daily Java Practice Automation (EC2 to GitHub)

This repository contains my daily Java practice code. Each day, code updates are automatically committed and pushed from an AWS EC2 instance using a scheduled script.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- To track my **daily progress** in Java.
- To build consistency with **daily coding habits**.
- To automatically **version control** my code using Git and GitHub.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- I write or update my Java code daily on an EC2 instance.
- A shell script runs every night to:
  1. Stage all changes
  2. Commit with a date-based message
  3. Push the code to this GitHub repo

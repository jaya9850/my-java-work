##CONSTRUCTOR 
A constructor is a special method in Java used to initialize objects. 
It has the same name as the class and no return type (not even void).
OVERRIDING
Method name, return type, and parameters must be exactly the same.

Used in inheritance.

Provides runtime polymorphism.

The subclass version overrides the superclass method.

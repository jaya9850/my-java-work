Encapsulation: Hiding data members
inside class outside func = instance variable // gobal access
inside class inside function = local variable // local access
this keyword represent current class
get = give value
set = store in our variabl 


Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It involves bundling data (variables or attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, often called a class. A key aspect of encapsulation is data hiding, which means restricting direct access to the internal data of an object from outside the class.

Here's how it works:

*   **Data Hiding:** You can restrict access to variables (also known as attributes or fields) by making them private. This means they can only be accessed and modified within the class itself. This prevents accidental or unauthorized modification of the data from external code.
*   **Controlled Access:** Instead of direct access, you provide methods (often called "getters" and "setters") to read and modify the data. These methods act as an interface, allowing controlled access and validation of the data.
*   **Binding Data and Methods:** Encapsulation binds the data and the methods that work with that data together. This makes the code more organized, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.

Example:

Consider a bank account:

*   The data members (attributes) could be account number, balance, and account holder name.
*   The methods (functions) could be deposit, withdraw, check balance, and transfer funds.

By encapsulating these, you can:

*   Restrict direct access to the account balance.
*   Ensure that withdrawals don't allow negative balances.
*   Provide methods for interacting with the account in a controlled and secure manner.

In essence, encapsulation promotes modularity, data protection, and maintainability in software development.
